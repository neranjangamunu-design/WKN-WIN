# Anti-Gravity E-Commerce System

As requested, here is the "Supri System" (Superb System) designed with an Anti-Gravity concept.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). No installation required.

## Features
1.  **Storefront**:
    -   Sleek, modern "Anti-Gravity" design.
    -   Browse items (T-shirts, hoodies, etc.).
    -   Add to cart and checkout.
2.  **Admin Dashboard**:
    -   Click "Admin" in the navigation.
